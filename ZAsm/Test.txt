bait ; This would just trigger an exception (but designed for debuggers)
syscall ; This would also just trigger an exception (but designed for operating system calls)

x: ; Defines a label (e.g. for the start of a function)
addimm $r0, $r0, 100
addimm $r0, $r0, (x + (100 | -30))
add $r0, $r1, $rstack
blink $r3 ; This would just save the next instruction pointer
ifequals $r0, $r0, x ; This would just loop back to the "x" label ($r0 would always equal $r0)
